        <p>This project involves training an agent using Deep Q-Learning to play the Lunar Lander game, a classic OpenAI Gym environment. The goal is to safely land the lunar module on the landing pad while avoiding crashes and conserving fuel.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #555;">Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The agent is trained using a neural network to approximate the Q-values for each possible action. The network consists of three fully connected layers with ReLU activations. The agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy to explore the environment, gradually shifting from exploration to exploitation as the training progresses.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #555;">Deep Q-Network Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input Layer:</strong> 8-dimensional state space representing the lunar lander's position, velocity, and angle.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Layers:</strong> Two fully connected layers with 256 neurons each, using ReLU activations.</li>
            <li><strong>Output Layer:</strong> 4-dimensional action space representing the discrete actions the lander can take.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="color: #555;">Training Process</h2>
        <p>The training process involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initialize the replay memory to store the agent's experiences.</li>
            <li>For each episode, the agent interacts with the environment by choosing an action based on the epsilon-greedy policy.</li>
            <li>Store the transition (state, action, reward, next state, done) in the replay memory.</li>
            <li>Sample a batch of transitions from the memory and update the Q-network using the Bellman equation.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until the agent's performance stabilizes or a predefined number of episodes is reached.</li>
        </ol>
